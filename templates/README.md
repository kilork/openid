# OpenID Connect & Discovery client library using async / await

## Legal

Dual-licensed under `MIT` or the [UNLICENSE](http://unlicense.org/).

## Features

Implements [OpenID Connect Core 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) and [OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html).

Implements [UMA2](https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/wg/oauth-uma-federated-authz-2.0-09.html) - User Managed Access, an extension to OIDC/OAuth2. Use feature flag `uma2` to enable this feature.

Implements [OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7662).

Implements [PKCE: Proof Key for Code Exchange by OAuth Public Clients](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636). PKCE is enabled by default.

It supports Microsoft OIDC with feature `microsoft`. This adds methods for authentication and token validation, those skip issuer check.

Originally developed as a quick adaptation to leverage async/await functionality, based on [inth-oauth2](https://crates.io/crates/inth-oauth2) and [oidc](https://crates.io/crates/oidc), the library has since evolved into a mature and robust solution, offering expanded features and improved performance.

Using [reqwest](https://crates.io/crates/reqwest) for the HTTP client and [biscuit](https://crates.io/crates/biscuit) for Javascript Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE).

## Usage

Add dependency to Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
openid = "{{ env_var "OPENID_RUST_MAJOR_VERSION" }}"
```

By default we use native tls, if you want to use `rustls`:

```toml
[dependencies]
openid = { version = "{{ env_var "OPENID_RUST_MAJOR_VERSION" }}", default-features = false, features = ["rustls"] }
```

Alternatively, you can use `rustls` with the platformâ€™s native certificates:

```toml
[dependencies]
openid = { version = "{{ env_var "OPENID_RUST_MAJOR_VERSION" }}", default-features = false, features = ["rustls-native-roots"] }
```

### Use case: [Warp](https://crates.io/crates/warp) web server with [JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/) generated frontend and [Google OpenID Connect](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect)

This example provides only Rust part, assuming just default JHipster frontend settings.

in Cargo.toml:

{{ codeblock "toml" ( to "[patch.crates-io]" ( from "[dependencies]" ( http_get (replace "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kilork/openid-examples/vVERSION/Cargo.toml" "VERSION" (env_var "OPENID_RUST_MAJOR_VERSION") ) ) ) ) }}

in src/main.rs:

{{ codeblock "rust, compile_fail" ( http_get (replace "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kilork/openid-examples/vVERSION/examples/warp.rs" "VERSION" (env_var "OPENID_RUST_MAJOR_VERSION") ) ) }}
